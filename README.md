# Kaggle_Roller_Coaster_Analysis

Exploring and analyzing roller coaster data. I look at things like how many roller coasters were introduced each year,
and checking which years had the most roller coasters introduced. I also check the speeds of each roller coaster to see
how many can reach speeds of 100+ mph. 

I also check correlations between coaster speed and height and visualize it using a heat map.

I then check which locations have the fastest roller coasters and visualize this with a horizontal bar plot.
